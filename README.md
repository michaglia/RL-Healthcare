# Healthcare Management Reinforcement Learning
### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) environment for managing healthcare policies using Q-learning Value Function Approximation (VFA) and Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agents. The environment simulates a healthcare system of a government, where an agent must make decisions to optimize the healthcare level of a population while managing a limited budget and reducing the risk of a pandemic. The second important goal of the agent is to maintain a balance between healthcare and risk levels, while navigating through elections happening every 5 years and that can affect its tenure. \\
_Will the agent maintain its job or be fired during the next elections?_

##### ENVIRONMENT
###### State space: budget, health level, risk level
###### Action space: 
###### - 0: Increase health and decrease risk.
###### - 1: Improve quality of care while slightly increasing health.
###### - 2: Allocate resources without significant changes to health or risk.
